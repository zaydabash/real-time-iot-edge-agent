# nlohmann/json Single Header

To use nlohmann/json in the C++ agent, download the single-header file:

```bash
cd agent-cpp/third_party/nlohmann
curl -L https://github.com/nlohmann/json/releases/download/v3.11.2/json.hpp -o json.hpp
```

Or manually download from: https://github.com/nlohmann/json/releases

The agent will work without it (uses manual JSON formatting), but nlohmann/json provides better JSON handling.
